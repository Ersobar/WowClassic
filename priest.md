# bwl loot priority
Focus: Every priest gets the first T2 bonus as soon as possible!
> Notes:
> * Exactly one T2 set item from bwl is required for this
> * Every item not listed is either just a fun item or irrelevant

## weapons (how much it's worth)
* Benediction (Staff)
> 106 +heal, 31 int, 10 sta, 12 spirit, 2% crit

> 64 +heal, 4 mana/5, 17 int, 7 sta
* Lok'amir il Romathis (Mace)

* Lok'amir il Romathis + Lei of the Lifegiver
> 137 +heal, 3 mana/5, 18 int, 10 sta, 8 spirit
### conclusion
* Claw of Chromaggus + Lei of the Lifegiver vs. Benediction
> 11 +heal, 7 mana/5, -14 int, -3 sta, -12 spirit, -2% crit
> - **It's not worth it**
* Lok'amir il Romathis + Lei of the Lifegiver vs. Benediction
> 31 +heal, 3 mana/5, -13 int, -4 spirit, -2% crit
> - **a slight improvement**

## boss loot

### Razorgore the Untamed
* Bindings of Transcendence (T2 Wrist)
### Vaelastrasz the Corrupt
* Belt of Transcendence (T2 Waist)
### Broodlord Lashlayer
* Boots of Transcendence (T2 Feet)
### Firemaw

### Ebonroc
* Handguards of Transcendence (T2 Hands)
* Rejuvenating Gem (Trinket)
> high priority
### Flamegor
* Handguards of Transcendence (T2 Hands)
* Shroud of Pure Thought (Back)
* Rejuvenating Gem (Trinket)
> high priority
### Chromaggus
* Pauldrons of Transcendence (T2 Shoulder)
* Empowered Leggings (Legs)
> low priority: way more interesting for paladins (has 31 less add healing, but still is not T2)
* Claw of Chromaggus (Dagger)
> low priority: way more interesting for heal druids
### Nefarian
* Robes of Transcendence (T2 Chest)
* Pure Elementium Band (Ring)
> very high priority
* Lok'amir il Romathis (Main Hand)
> medium priority: if an druid or paladin wants the weapon, they should get it (because of the lack of alternatives)
